## Why do Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is used to determine which of the two non-overlapping hypotheses are supported by the provided data. We can do this by establishing a causal relationship between two or more variables through experiment or a difference between variables.
For Bioinformatics, we need to be confident in results we get from performing genomic analysis; therefore, hypothesis testing is needed. 
In order to perform hypothesis testing, **there are 5 steps that MUST be completed.**

## Form Hypotheses 

In order to prove a hypothesis, it’s a requirement to have **two opposing hypotheses** that are disjoint events. This means that if one is true, it is impossible for the other to be true as well. 

These hypotheses need to have these two features:
* Have reproducible results
* Have the possibility to be proven either false or true

These hypotheses have names and they are the **null hypothesis (H0)** and the **alternative hypothesis (H1)**

#### Null Hypothesis (H0)
* always predicts that there is no relationship between variables or no difference between variables 
* is assumed true until rejected by *not rejecting the alternative hypothesis*
* usually set to be the *simpler* one of the two

#### Alternative hypothesis (H1)
* needs to proven true 
* this hypothesis is the one that assumes there’s a relationship between variables

#### Testing your knowledge. Create the following hypotheses labeling your null and alternative hypothesis.
The equality of male and female birth rates.

Answer:
>! Null hypothesis: The birth rates of males and females are equal.
>! Alternative hypothesis: The birth rates of males and females are not equal.
>! This is the earliest use of statistical hypothesis testing, created in the 1700s by John Arbuthnot and continued by Pierre-Simon Laplace (of the famous Laplace transform in Calculus).

A lady’s ability to discern whether tea or milk was added first to a cup.

	Answer:
>! Null hypothesis: The probability of guessing randomly (50%) is equal to the lady's answers on whether tea then milk and milk then tea were added.
>! Alternative hypothesis: The lady’s answers are not random.
>! This is a famous British example known as the *Lady tasting tea*, by Dr. Muriel Bristol

 A defendant's guilt under the assumption that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty.

	Answer:
>! Null hypothesis: The defendant is innocent.
>! Alternative hypothesis: The defendant is guilty.

That a person is clairvoyant when blindly calling suites.

	Answer:
>! Null hypothesis: That the probability of the clairvoyant’s guesses are equal to or less than the probability of guessing the suite at random.
>! Alternative hypothesis: That the probability of the clairvoyant’s predictions are greater than the probability of guessing the suite at random. 


That the presence of a gene increases the chances of developing cancer.

	Answer:
>! Null hypothesis: The presence of a gene does not change the probability of developing cancer.
>! Alternative hypothesis: The presence of a gene does change the probability of developing cancer.

TODO: Decide which way is better to give the answers… below the questions or in a separate section..

Now that we have our hypotheses, we need to create a test design to gather data.

## Data and Test Design

Test design should contain the following
Discrimination - Clearly seperated hypotheses
Replication - Ability to be reproduced with the exact same conditions
Controls - Limited interference from outside variables. Set a placebo.
Blind/Randomized Design - Unbiased selection of experimental variables
Measurement - Ability to be quantified

The data collected/generated determines what hypothesis is supported. Data is generated by repeating an experiment under controlled conditions. The degree to which the results vary is tabulated into test statistics.

Data must: 
*  be **hypothesis-related data**
* support either hypothesis

#### Testing your knowledge. How could you collect data for the following

The equality of male and female birth rates.

	Answer:
>! Collect birth rates across multiple locations

A lady’s ability to discern whether tea or milk was added first to a cup.

	Answer:
>! Conduct multiple experiments making sure to use the same tea cup, have the temperature, contain equal proportions of tea and milk, and try to limit human interaction.
>! Tone of voice as well as many other factors could unconsciously transfer information.

That a person is clairvoyant when blindly calling suites.

>! Conduct multiple experiments making sure that there is no variation in tone of voice or movement in the presenter.

That the presence of a gene increases the chances of developing cancer.

> ! Select a random assortment of the population that both contain and do not contain the gene. Then, over a long period of time, check evolving cancer rates for both groups.
> ! Or compare a control group of mice to genetically engineered mouse models for cancer research as seen [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3533445/). 

TODO: Add an example requiring the use of those bioinformatic databases.

These are some *common Bioinformatic Databases*: 
* GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/)
* NCBI GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/)
* IHEC (epigenome) (https://epigenomesportal.ca/ihec/about.html) 
* More can be found at this website (https://libraryguides.mcgill.ca/bioinformatics/databases) 

Now that the hypothesis-related data is obtained, some data transformations are needed in order for the data to be usable

## Form Test Statistic

TODO: I got this section. I will try to use the examples above to showcase some of the different test types.

There are four different suites each with thirteen cards giving a  ¼ probability that a guess would be correct.

## Calculate the P-value

## Make a Decision

After obtaining the p-value, a decision can now be made! 
There are two possible decisions:
* **Reject the H0** if the test statistic is greater than our level of significance.
* Don’t Reject, **accept, the H0 otherwise**

The smaller the p-value → the greater the belief we have against the H0

> **If the p-value is low, the null must go.**

The cutoff for the p-value that we choose,**USUALLY**, is 0.05 in order to *reject the null hypothesis*


#### *What if the decision we made is wrong?*
There are two types of errors that we can make and they are: 
* **Type I Error (False Positive)** = reject a true null hypothesis and is a considerably worse error
* **Type II Error (False Negative)** = When you accept a false null hypothesis

Here is an illustration of the type of decisions that can be made
