## Why do Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is used to determine which of the two non-overlapping hypotheses are supported by the provided data. We can do this by establishing a causal relationship between two or more variables through experiment or a difference between variables.
For Bioinformatics, we need to be confident in results we get from performing genomic analysis; therefore, hypothesis testing is needed. 
In order to perform hypothesis testing, **there are 5 steps that MUST be completed.**

## Form Hypotheses 

In order to prove a hypothesis, it’s a requirement to have **two opposing hypotheses** that are disjoint events. This means that if one is true, it is impossible for the other to be true as well. 

These hypotheses need to have these two features:
* Have reproducible results
* Have the possibility to be proven either false or true

These hypotheses have names and they are the **null hypothesis (H0)** and the **alternative hypothesis (H1)**

#### Null Hypothesis (H0)
* always predicts that there is no relationship between variables or no difference between variables 
* is assumed true until rejected by *not rejecting the alternative hypothesis*
* usually set to be the *simpler* one of the two

#### Alternative hypothesis (H1)
* needs to proven true 
* this hypothesis is the one that assumes there’s a relationship between variables

So now that there are two testable hypotheses, data is needed!

## Data and Test Design

The data collected/generated determines what hypothesis is supported. Data is generated by repeating an experiment under controlled conditions. The degree to which the results vary is tabulated into test statistics.

Data must: 
*  be **hypothesis-related data**
* support either hypothesis 

These are some *common Bioinformatic Databases*: 
* GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/)
* NCBI GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/)
* IHEC (epigenome) (https://epigenomesportal.ca/ihec/about.html) 
* More can be found at this website (https://libraryguides.mcgill.ca/bioinformatics/databases) 

Now that the hypothesis-related data is obtained, some data transformations are needed in order for the data to be usable

## Make a Decision

After obtaining the p-value, a decision can now be made! 
There are two possible decisions:
* **Reject the H0** if the test statistic is greater than our level of significance.
* Don’t Reject, **accept, the H0 otherwise**

The smaller the p-value → the greater the belief we have against the H0

> **If the p-value is low, the null must go.**

The cutoff for the p-value that we choose,**USUALLY**, is 0.05 in order to *reject the null hypothesis*

#### *What if the decision we made is wrong?*
There are two types of errors that we can make and they are: 
* **Type I Error (False Positive)** = reject a true null hypothesis and is a considerably worse error
* **Type II Error (False Negative)** = When you accept a false null hypothesis

Here is an illustration of the type of decisions that can be made
