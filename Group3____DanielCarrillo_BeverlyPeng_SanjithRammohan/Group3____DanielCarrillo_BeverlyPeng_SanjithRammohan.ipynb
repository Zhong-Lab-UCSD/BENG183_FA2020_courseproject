    "There are many strategies to cluster data, all of which depend on what the ultimate goal is. Clustering is an **unsupervised** learning problem, meaning the algorithm does not have a reference to check accuracy. All of them rely on different mathematical computations that are used to determine how similar these data are. When these similarities are weighted differently, various clustering patterns can occur. \n",

    "**Hierarchical clustering** is one of these methods where the goal is to input a data matrix and output a clustering of groupings that represent similarly expressed data closer within clusters than across other clusters. "

    "The goal of hierarchical clustering is simple: to build a tree diagram where the input data that are most similar to each other are placed on branches that are closer together, called a dendrogram. We know how close branches are to one another based on the height of the branch, which represents the amount of dissimilarity between clusters (see image above). The further to the right that the dendrogram the branch splits, the larger the dissimilarity value, meaning the more different the clusters are from one another. Walking through the algorithm step to step, it soon becomes clear that the features that merge into the same cluster sooner are more similar than those that merge later."
