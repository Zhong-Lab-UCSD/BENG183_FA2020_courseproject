## Why do Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is used to determine which of the two non-overlapping hypotheses are supported by the provided data. We can do this by establishing a causal relationship between two or more variables through experiment or a difference between variables.
For Bioinformatics, we need to be confident in results we get from performing genomic analysis; therefore, hypothesis testing is needed. 
In order to perform hypothesis testing, **there are 5 steps that MUST be completed.**

## Form Hypotheses 

In order to prove a hypothesis, it’s a requirement to have **two opposing hypotheses** that are disjoint events. This means that if one is true, it is impossible for the other to be true as well. 

These hypotheses need to have these two features:
* Have reproducible results
* Have the possibility to be proven either false or true

These hypotheses are called the **null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>)** and the **alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>)**

#### Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>)
* always predicts that there is no relationship between variables or no difference between variables 
* is assumed true until rejected by *not rejecting the alternative hypothesis*
* usually set to be the *simpler* one of the two

#### Alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>)
* needs to proven true 
* this hypothesis is the one that assumes there’s a relationship between variables

These tests can be quantitatively represented in the following ways:

### One-sided hypothesis tests

H<sub>0</sub>: μ ≥ 0
H<sub>1</sub>: μ < 0

H<sub>0</sub>: μ ≤ 0
H<sub>1</sub>: μ > 0

#### Two-sided hypothesis test

H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 0
H<sub>1</sub>: μ ≠ 0

#### Testing your knowledge. Create the following hypotheses, stating if it is one-sided to two-sided and labeling your null and alternative hypothesis.

1. The equality of male and female birth rates.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	Two-sided hypothesis test.
Null hypothesis: The birth rates of males and females are equal.
Alternative hypothesis: The birth rates of males and females are not equal.
This is the earliest use of statistical hypothesis testing, created in the 1700s by John Arbuthnot and continued by Pierre-Simon Laplace (of the famous Laplace transform in Calculus).
</details>

2. A lady’s ability to discern whether tea or milk was added first to a cup.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	Two-sided hypothesis test.
Null hypothesis: The probability of guessing randomly (50%) is equal to the lady's answers on whether tea then milk and milk then tea were added.
Alternative hypothesis: The lady’s answers are statistically significant and not random.
This is a famous British example known as the *Lady tasting tea*, by Dr. Muriel Bristol.
</details>

3. That a person is clairvoyant when blindly calling suites.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	Two-sided hypothesis test.
Null hypothesis: That the probability of the clairvoyant’s guesses are equal to or less than the probability of guessing the suite at random.
Alternative hypothesis: That the probability of the clairvoyant’s predictions are greater than the probability of guessing the suite at random. 
</details>

4. That the presence of a gene increases the chances of developing cancer.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	One-sided hypothesis test.
Null hypothesis: The presence of a gene does not change the probability of developing cancer.
Alternative hypothesis: The presence of a gene does change the probability of developing cancer.
</details>

Now that we have our hypotheses, we need to create a test design to gather data.

## Data and Test Design

Test design should contain the following:
Discrimination - Clearly seperated hypotheses.
Replication - Ability to be reproduced with the exact same conditions.
Controls - Limit interference from outside variables. Set a negative and positive control.
Blind/Randomized Design - Unbiased selection of experimental variables.
Measurement - Ability to be quantified.

The data collected/generated determines what hypothesis is supported. Data is generated by repeating an experiment under controlled conditions. The degree to which the results vary is tabulated into test statistics.

Data must: 
*  be **hypothesis-related data**
* support either hypothesis

#### Testing your knowledge. How could you collect data for the following

The equality of male and female birth rates.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
Accumulate birth rates across multiple locations
</details>

A lady’s ability to discern whether tea or milk was added first to a cup.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
Conduct multiple experiments making sure to use the same tea cup, the same temperature, contain equal proportions of tea and milk, and try to limit human interaction as tone of voice as well as many other factors could unconsciously transfer information.
</details>

That a person is clairvoyant when blindly calling suites.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
Conduct multiple experiments making sure that there is no variation in tone of voice or movement in the presenter or any markings on the cards being presented.
</details>

That the presence of a mutated gene increases the chances of developing cancer.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
Select a random assortment of the population that both contain and do not contain the gene and tabulate cancer rates for both groups.
Another approach would be to compare a control group of mice to genetically engineered mouse models with the mutation. This common procedure for cancer research can be seen [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3533445/).

Now that the hypothesis-related data is obtained, some data transformations are needed in order for the data to be usable

## Form Test Statistic

All test statistic equations take the general form:

![teststatistic2](/Group29_Final/teststatistic2.png)

Data will need to be summarized into a *single number* called a **statistic**.
If the magnitude of the statistic supports *either hypothesis*, then it’s called a **test statistic**.

### List of Different Test Statistics
##### Z-Statistic (Z-Test)
* Determines if two means are different assuming normal distribution using a known standard deviation as the average variation.

##### T-Statistic (T-Test)
* Used instead of a Z Test replacing average variation with the sample’s standard deviation.

##### Chi-Square Statistic (Chi-Square Test)
* Determines if at least one of these expected percentages are incorrect given our sampling data. Used for tests of homogeneity and tests of independence. Used to test if our sample distribution fits our null distribution for factors which, when added, equal the whole subset. Average variation is replaced with the expected percentages of each given factor.

##### Logistic Regression
* Determines if the probability of an obtained event can be shown as a linear function of a combination of predictor variables. Models of the data are in binary values and must not be correlated with each other.
 
##### Linear Regression
* Determines if the data’s relationship can be modeled using a straight line. The relationship between independent and dependent variables is required and correlation could exist.

##### Multiple Regression
* Determines if a dependent variable can be determined using multiple independent variables to either create a linear regression or a non-linear regression. It is rare that a dependent variable is explained by only one other variable. It is assumed that there is no major correlation between the independent variables.

##### F-Statistic (ANOVA)
* ANOVA stands for analysis of variance. Generally used as the first statistical test as it can compare multiple groups to determine if, given a single variable, somewhere between the groups there is a significant difference. Afterwards, there would still need to occur (N choose 2) T-Tests to find which specific group interactions are statistically significant.

##### Multivariate F-Statistic (MANOVA)
* Similar to ANOVA, but compares multiple variables between groups.

### How to Choose Which Statistical Test

![flowchart](/Group29_Final/flowchart-for-choosing-a-statistical-test.png)

### Testing your knowledge

You suspect that an ancestral mutation to a specific gene is the cause for a higher likelihood of developing breast cancer in women. In the U.S., about 1 in 400 people have the mutation. You take a sample of 100 women aged 70 without the mutation and find that 7 have breast cancer. You take a sample of 100 women aged 70 with the mutation and find that 40 have breast cancer. Test if this gene can be said to increase the development of breast cancer with a 95% confidence interval. Let mutation and normal be represented by the letters m and n respectively. Let N represent the sample number. State the following:

Null hypothesis: The mutated gene does not increase the chance of cancer. 

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>m</sub> - μ<sub>n</sub> <= 0
The percentage of women with cancer given the presence of the mutation is less than or equal to the percentage of women with cancer given no mutation.
</details>

Alternative hypothesis: Presence of the mutated gene increases the chance of cancer.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
H <sub>1</sub> : μ <sub>m</sub> - μ <sub>n</sub> > 0
The percentage of women with cancer given the presence of the mutation is greater than the percentage of women with cancer given no mutation.
</details>

Mutation Mean and Average Variation:

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
μ <sub>1</sub> = P <sub>m</sub> = .07
σ <sup>2</sup> = P <sub>m</sub> (1-P <sub>m</sub> )/N = ~.0007
</details>

Normal Mean and Average Variation:

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
μ <sub>2</sub> = P <sub>n</sub> = .40
σ <sup>2</sup> = P <sub>n</sub> (1-P <sub>n</sub> )/N = ~.0024
</details>

Sample Distribution and Standard deviation:

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
μ <sub>Pm</sub> - μ <sub>Pn</sub> = |0.07 - 0.47| = 0.33
σ <sub>Pm-Pn</sub> = (.0007 + .0024) <sup>1/2</sup> = ~0.0557

For a 95% chance that it is within the distance of the mean, the t table gives the value of 1.984. Find the confidence interval:

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
1.984(0.0557) = 0.1105
</details>

Therefore, we are 95% confident that:

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
It falls between the interval: 0.33+-0.1105
</details>

Assuming the null hypothesis is correct, calculate the t statistic using the general formula for test statistics as a guide:

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
Assuming P <sub>m</sub> = P <sub>n</sub> = P
σ <sub>Pm-Pn</sub> = [2P(1-P)/100] <sup>1/2</sup> = ~0.0424
Therefore, t = (.33 - 0) / 0.0424 = 7.783 with a mean of 0.
</details>

What is the conclusion?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
Given a significance level of 5%, since our critical t value is less than the t value above, we can be 95% confident that the presence of the mutation contributes to the beast cancer and reject the null hypothesis. These statistics in this example reflect the percentages caused by the BRCA1 mutation.

## Calculate the P-value

After a limited amount of tests, the hypothesis test makes an inference which is extrapolated for all cases with a given amount of uncertainty.

The **p-value** calculates the probability that we would get the same test statistic or “worse” value, if we repeat the experiment multiple times.

### How to calculate the P-value:

P-value = 1 - FT|H <sub>0</sub> (t)

>  FT|H <sub>0</sub> (t) = cumulative distribution function (CDF) = distribution of the Test Statistic under H <sub>0</sub>

### How to find the CDF under the H <sub>0</sub>:

Computer simulation: simulate random outcomes by using the numbers from the test statistic and keep swapping them for many simulations (approximation of null distribution)

### Example
You read an article that said 6% of NCAA students go to the professional level. You think it’s higher at your college. You take a random sample of 50 NCAA students and see that 11% of them are going pro. 
You are puzzled and do 40 random simulations of n = 50 NCAA students for a large population where 2% of them go pro. You noted the percentage you got every simulation. Here’s a graph of them: 
![plot](/Group29_Final/plot.PNG)
> We have our statistic p = 0.06 (NOT P-value)

> Our null hypothesis is that the 0.06 applies to your school: H <sub>0</sub> : p = 0.06

> So our alt hypothesis is that it’s higher at your school: H <sub>1</sub> : p > 0.06

> NOTE: These are disjoint sets and the H <sub>0</sub> and H <sub>1</sub> can’t happen at the same time.

> So now we can start approximating our p-value 
> p-val = P(P <sub>school</sub> ≥ 11% | H0) = 5/40 = 0.125
> We got this by counting the number of simulations where the p ≥ 0.11 and dividing it by the total number of simulations 
From this example we got our **p-val to be equal to 0.125**. What do we do now? 
---
## Make a Decision

After obtaining the p-value, a decision can now be made! 
There are two possible decisions:
* **Reject the H0** if the p-value is less than our level of significance .
* Don’t Reject, **accept, the H0 otherwise**

The smaller the p-value → the greater the belief we have against the H0

> **If the p-value is low, the null must go.**

The cutoff for the p-value that we choose,**USUALLY**, is 0.05 in order to *reject the null hypothesis*

> From our previous example, we saw that our p-value was **0.125** which is higher than our level of significance. 

> 0.125 > 0.05 
> therefore we can say that **we accept the H <sub>0</sub> ** and that there is no statistical significance 

#### *What if the decision we made is wrong?*
There are two types of errors that we can make and they are: 
* **Type I Error (False Positive)** = reject a true null hypothesis and is a considerably worse error
* **Type II Error (False Negative)** = When you accept a false null hypothesis

Here is an illustration of the type of decisions that can be made:

![Errors](/Group29_Final/type-1-2-errors.png)

#### Is it possible to remove all errors?
**It isn’t** because there is a tradeoff between the types of error; if we decrease the probability of one then the probability of the other increases and vise versa. This is seen by the following graph.
