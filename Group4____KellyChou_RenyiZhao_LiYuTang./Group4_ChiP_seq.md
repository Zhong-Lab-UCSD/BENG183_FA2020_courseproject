## 1. Introduction<a name="1"></a>


![chip_seq pipeline](./images/Intro.png)

ChIP-Sequencing stands for chromatin-immunoprecipitation and focuses on protein-DNA interactions. It uses antibodies to select specific proteins or nucleosomes that are then hybridized to a microarray to identify the DNA fragments later. It enriches for DNA fragments bound to proteins or nucleosomes.

The goal of ChIP-Sequencing is to map binding sites of any DNA binding protein, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, and other protein-DNA interactions.

## 2. ChIP-Sequencing Workflow<a name="2"></a>

### 1) Experimental Workflow<a name="21"></a>

1. **Crosslink**:
The proteins are first crosslinked to the DNA using formaldehyde.
2. **Shear Chromatin**:
Then, the chromatin is sheared into smaller pieces by sonication or enzymes to digest them.
3. **Add protein-specific antibody**:
Next, the antibodies for the specific protein in question is added.
4. **Immunoprecipitation**:
Later, the DNA is immunoprecipitated to isolate and concentrate the particular protein in question.
5. **Purify DNA**:
The crosslinks are reversed and the DNA is purified using the antibody-bound magnetic beads.
6. **Prepare for sequencing**:
The immunoprecipitated DNA is now prepared to be used for a next-generation sequencing to be analyzed for DNA binding sites.

### 2) Computational Analysis<a name="22"></a>

![chip_seq experimental](./images/computational.jpg)

Depending on if there is a small-scale analysis, like a single or small sample,or a large-scale anaylsis with many samples, different analysis strategies may be used. Peak calling is comparing different peaks from each experiment. For larger-scale analyses, a relaxed threshold to compare the peaks may be used. Normally differential analysis is used for small-scale samples, but other analysis strategies may be used to further analyze: 
- Functional analysis: motif analysis, gene ontology
- Integration with other technologies
- Validation: qPCR, knockdown analysis

## 3. Advantages<a name="3"></a>
- **Mapping**

    Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) can be used to map DNA-binding proteins and histone modifications in a genome-wide manner at base-pair         resolution.
    
- **Higher resolution, less noise, higher genome coverage and wider dynamic range**

- **Requires few amounts of DNA**
    
    Generates a more precise list of protein binding sites and targets of transcription factors, enhancers, and identification of sequence motifs. Detailed profiling of           histone modifications and nucleosome positions enables greater understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in development and differentiation.
 
- **Repetitive regions in the genome can now be examined**

- **Increased sensitivity and specificity**

    Increased sensitivity and specificity in the mapping of transcription factor binding sites has facilitated motif discovery and target identification.
    
- **It also offers compatibility with various input DNA samples.**

- **Single nucleotide resolution**

    While the resolution for ChIP-chip varied by arrays but was generally in the range of 30-100 bp.
    
- **Eliminate signal noise**

    During ChIP-chip’s hybridization process there may be cross-hybridization between imperfectly matched sequences, which adds to signal noise. ChIP-seq is intrinsically         immune to such sources of noise due to the direct sequencing method.

## 4. Disadvatages<a name="4"></a>
- **High cost and availability**

    ChIP-chip costs $400–$800 per array (1–6 million probes) but multiple arrays may be needed for large genomes, however ChIP-Seq cost around $1000–$2000 per Illumina lane       (6–15 million readsprior to alignment)

- **High quality of antibodies required**

    ChIP-seq makes use of antibodies in immunoprecipitation, hence the quality of the data relies on the high quality of the antibody. However, antibodies vary widely in           quality between suppliers and batches.

- **Required large amounts of tissue**

    It requires a lot of tissue to be prohibitive for some rare sample types. The peaks in the profiles needed to be compared to the same loci of the control sample to make        the result more accurate.

- **Prior knowledge of DNA-binding protein required**

    Prior knowledge of specific binding sites are needed for the antibodies to see where they exactly bind to the protein that we are interested in. 
    
- **Bias in high GC-rich content in fragment selection**

# Code
You can reference variables like `x` or `y` inline.
But you can also have block quotes like:
```
import numpy as np
random = np.random.randn(10, 10)

print('Hello World!')
```
But you can even format the text for languages:
```python
import numpy as np
random = np.random.randn(10, 10)

print('Hello World!')
```
**Pretty!**
