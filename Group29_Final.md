## Why do Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is used to determine which of the two non-overlapping hypotheses are supported by the provided data. We can do this by establishing a causal relationship between two or more variables through experiment or a difference between variables.
For Bioinformatics, we need to be confident in results we get from performing genomic analysis; therefore, hypothesis testing is needed. 
In order to perform hypothesis testing, **there are 5 steps that MUST be completed.**

## Form Hypotheses 

In order to prove a hypothesis, it’s a requirement to have **two opposing hypotheses** that are disjoint events. This means that if one is true, it is impossible for the other to be true as well. 

These hypotheses need to have these two features:
* Have reproducible results
* Have the possibility to be proven either false or true

These hypotheses have names and they are the **null hypothesis (H0)** and the **alternative hypothesis (H1)**

#### Null Hypothesis (H0)
* always predicts that there is no relationship between variables or no difference between variables 
* is assumed true until rejected by *not rejecting the alternative hypothesis*

#### Alternative hypothesis (H1)
* needs to proven true 
* this hypothesis is the one that assumes there’s a relationship between variables

So now that there are two testable hypotheses, data is needed!
