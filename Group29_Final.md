## Why do Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing is used to determine which of the two non-overlapping hypotheses are supported by the provided data. We can do this by establishing a causal relationship between two or more variables through experiment or a difference between variables.
For Bioinformatics, we need to be confident in results we get from performing genomic analysis; therefore, hypothesis testing is needed. 
In order to perform hypothesis testing, **there are 5 steps that MUST be completed.**
